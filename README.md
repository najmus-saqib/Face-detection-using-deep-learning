# Face detection with OpenCV and deep learning
In this project you will be able to perform fast, accurate face detection in inages and videos with OpenCV using a pre-trained deep learning face detector model shipped with the library.

When using OpenCV’s deep neural network module with Caffe models, you’ll need two sets of files:
•	The .prototxt file(s) which define the model architecture (i.e., the layers themselves)
•	The .caffemodel file which contains the weights for the actual layers
